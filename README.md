# Adventures of Coding with Michelle and Darryl ðŸ˜Ž

## Day 1 
* This coding question was pretty fun; we struggled with getting Java to compile in VS Code, but decided to switch to Python and it instantly made life easier!
## Day 2
* Originally tried to do with brute force comparisons in if statements. The next day, refactored solution to use a dictionary which made it much cleaner.
## Day 3
* Immediately jumped to a hashmap/dict solution, learned about ord() in python and ASCII characters. Getting used to using key/values for solutions. Could have come up with a better way to discern between 3 lines rather than an accumulator.?
## Day 4
* ???
